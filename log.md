# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday May 4, 2020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Declared I would be beginning challenge. Read articles on Free Code Camp, wrote down my why and decided to progress through Free Code Camp's course as well as working on Skillcrush/Personal Projects during this 100 day period.

**Thoughts:** I am AFRAID. Learning to code and getting a job in development, is something that has been on my mind for a WHILE. Whether or not I would able to hack it is something that's also constantly looming in my head. My inability to progress through previous courses has also made me feel like this is something that's beyond me. If I can commit for these 100 days, I think that will do wonders for my own self-belief that this is something I CAN do.

### Day 1: Tuesday May 5th, 2020 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Began Free Code Camp's Course. Moved through 100% of HTML, now 15% through CSS

**Thoughts**: I really liked a lot of the things said in this blog post yesterday. I flew through html because I am familiar with a lot of it, but there was still some new things that I picked up. Going through these in a different arena will help me iron out the issues I have with feeling like there are aspects of the basics/fundamentals that I am missing.

### Day 2: Wednesday May 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS and moved into Applied Visual Design, 35% through.

**Thoughts** It's quite cool, going through these classes. As initially when I read the name of a lot of the tasks, I thought I didn't know how to do them, but on the whole I actually do. This is reinforcing how much I actually do know, and have learnt in the past weeks and goodness even years. At first, these now 'easy' things were complicated, so I will endeavour to not get too overwhelmed when getting into the meatier stuff. As one day those complex ideas will be something I take in my stride too - she says!

I came across an adorable css penguin in one of today's challenges and I want to try making something like this. Excited for my first project.

### Day 3: Thursday May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 75% way through Applied Visual Design now. Tried making a little landing page to show how my heart swells re-watching Glee lol. Will animate tomorrow.

**Thoughts** hsl colour codes - never heard of them. Thought at first, why on earth would you want this? Then did an exercise with them and realised they're pretty dang cool.
Encountered how the transform property works!
animated my first key frames, omg

### Day 4: Friday May 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Visual Design and now onto accessibility design. 30% through.

Tried animating my heart, but for the life of me, wasn't able to make the heart change color completely on hover. I know it's because of the class name '.heart:after/before' messing it up, but I don't know how to resolve it.

In other news, learn the basics of css animations. Thought about trying to make a digital landscape with sparkling stars.

**Thoughts** Watched some videos on software engineering. Considering if this path is too difficult. If tech was for me, wouldn't I have cracked it by now? In other news, pleased with the accountability that this challenge is putting on me.

### Day 5: Sunday May 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed accessibility design. Picked up a lot of new info about forms and tabindex's that I didn't previously know. In fact, about 90% of this curriculum was new to me.

**Thoughts** Think I got discouraged over the weekend, but back on track today. Got in 30 mins, tomorrow will push for whole hour. Will be starting on responsive, which is where I've stumbled with Skillcrush course so I think it will be fruitful.

### Day 6: Monday May 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had the random idea for a Chris Messina movie generator after watching 'Blame' last night. Who doesn't want a tool to tell them just which Chris project to fire up depending on their mood?

Planned out the build, it built the html shell. Took a good mo to remember the js essentials but got there.

Now to figure out how to display the info I want. I'm not sure if I need to build a PHP form, or create if/else statements for each different answer combination. I think the latter is certainly not the right answer.

**Thoughts** This was fun. Definitely more enjoyable than going through tutorials. When there's no solution to download to check, I feel a bit more like I'm really making something new which is cool.

### Day 6: Monday May 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through responsive web design

**Thoughts** Very tired so didn't get uber far. keep thinking about how I'm going to produce these results for movie generator. I think the answer could be in javascript, but at this stage have kind of no ID where to start. Thinking will likely move on and come back at later date.
