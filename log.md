# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 4, 2020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Declared I would be beginning challenge. Read articles on Free Code Camp, wrote down my why and decided to progress through Free Code Camp's course as well as working on Skillcrush/Personal Projects during this 100 day period.

**Thoughts:** I am AFRAID. Learning to code and getting a job in development, is something that has been on my mind for a WHILE. Whether or not I would able to hack it is something that's also constantly looming in my head. My inability to progress through previous courses has also made me feel like this is something that's beyond me. If I can commit for these 100 days, I think that will do wonders for my own self-belief that this is something I CAN do.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
