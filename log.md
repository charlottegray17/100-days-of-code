# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday May 4, 2020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Declared I would be beginning challenge. Read articles on Free Code Camp, wrote down my why and decided to progress through Free Code Camp's course as well as working on Skillcrush/Personal Projects during this 100 day period.

**Thoughts:** I am AFRAID. Learning to code and getting a job in development, is something that has been on my mind for a WHILE. Whether or not I would able to hack it is something that's also constantly looming in my head. My inability to progress through previous courses has also made me feel like this is something that's beyond me. If I can commit for these 100 days, I think that will do wonders for my own self-belief that this is something I CAN do.

### Day 1: Tuesday May 5th, 2020 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Began Free Code Camp's Course. Moved through 100% of HTML, now 15% through CSS

**Thoughts**: I really liked a lot of the things said in this blog post yesterday. I flew through html because I am familiar with a lot of it, but there was still some new things that I picked up. Going through these in a different arena will help me iron out the issues I have with feeling like there are aspects of the basics/fundamentals that I am missing.

### Day 2: Wednesday May 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS and moved into Applied Visual Design, 35% through.

**Thoughts** It's quite cool, going through these classes. As initially when I read the name of a lot of the tasks, I thought I didn't know how to do them, but on the whole I actually do. This is reinforcing how much I actually do know, and have learnt in the past weeks and goodness even years. At first, these now 'easy' things were complicated, so I will endeavour to not get too overwhelmed when getting into the meatier stuff. As one day those complex ideas will be something I take in my stride too - she says!

I came across an adorable css penguin in one of today's challenges and I want to try making something like this. Excited for my first project.

### Day 3: Thursday May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 75% way through Applied Visual Design now. Tried making a little landing page to show how my heart swells re-watching Glee lol. Will animate tomorrow.

**Thoughts** hsl colour codes - never heard of them. Thought at first, why on earth would you want this? Then did an exercise with them and realised they're pretty dang cool.
Encountered how the transform property works!
animated my first key frames, omg

### Day 4: Friday May 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Visual Design and now onto accessibility design. 30% through.

Tried animating my heart, but for the life of me, wasn't able to make the heart change color completely on hover. I know it's because of the class name '.heart:after/before' messing it up, but I don't know how to resolve it.

In other news, learn the basics of css animations. Thought about trying to make a digital landscape with sparkling stars.

**Thoughts** Watched some videos on software engineering. Considering if this path is too difficult. If tech was for me, wouldn't I have cracked it by now? In other news, pleased with the accountability that this challenge is putting on me.

### Day 5: Sunday May 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed accessibility design. Picked up a lot of new info about forms and tabindex's that I didn't previously know. In fact, about 90% of this curriculum was new to me.

**Thoughts** Think I got discouraged over the weekend, but back on track today. Got in 30 mins, tomorrow will push for whole hour. Will be starting on responsive, which is where I've stumbled with Skillcrush course so I think it will be fruitful.

### Day 6: Monday May 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had the random idea for a Chris Messina movie generator after watching 'Blame' last night. Who doesn't want a tool to tell them just which Chris project to fire up depending on their mood?

Planned out the build, it built the html shell. Took a good mo to remember the js essentials but got there.

Now to figure out how to display the info I want. I'm not sure if I need to build a PHP form, or create if/else statements for each different answer combination. I think the latter is certainly not the right answer.

**Thoughts** This was fun. Definitely more enjoyable than going through tutorials. When there's no solution to download to check, I feel a bit more like I'm really making something new which is cool.

### Day 7: Tuesday May 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through responsive web design

**Thoughts** Very tired so didn't get uber far. keep thinking about how I'm going to produce these results for movie generator. I think the answer could be in javascript, but at this stage have kind of no ID where to start. Thinking will likely move on and come back at later date.

### Day 8: Wednesday May 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on trying to crack Javascript functions for project.

**Thoughts** Who knew this movie generator would be such a touch cookie to crack!? Came up with the answer to produce results seemingly in my dreams. I think I need to assign each movie a number, prep the appearance (description, title and img) and then find a way to make the options the user chooses, equal a number which we correspond with the relevant movie and throw up the info.

If only it was so easily done! Am having a good time trying to wrap›¢›› my head around this. When I figure it, I think I may feel invincible.

### Day 9: Thursday May 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit on portfolio landing page.
Making it responsive, and positioning images for once and for all with new knowledge.

**Thoughts** I have been working on this for far too long XD

### Day 10: Friday May 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started in on Flexbox

**Thoughts** My eyes are red. Will pick up tomorrow with fresh eyes!

**To Do's**

### Day 11: Sunday May 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through Flexbox. Built a calculator. Tried to apply calculator reasoning to movie generator. Still not hitting the spot mate. Missed a day yesterday. Will style my calculator later.

**Thoughts** This movie generator may be the death of me

UPDATE: It's now technically Monday, but there has been a BREAKTHROUGH!

Movie generator is partially up and running!!!

**Tonight's Progress**: After many failed attempts, but some really good thinking if I say so myself I have used js statements to get the generator to produce results as hoped. It's quite prescriptive due to all 5 statements need to be a certain result, before producing the one Messina title that matches all the statements, but I did it. And I did it on my own which feels good.

I also figured out a few things along the way about how best to call variables, different ways to display them on the page, and how to work with commenting out code. I used trial and error on certain function over and over to determine why the weren't working at what needed to be done to make them function. w3Schools and Stackoverflow I know very well are going to be my new home.

Tomorrow, I will finish plugging in the answers. I'm not sure what will happen in the case that two titles yield from the same results. That will be a good experiment to run I suppose!

Still it's now 02:14 am and I am done for the night. I will rest soundly for the next 5 hours.

### Day 12: Monday May 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made breakthrough with generator in the early hours, but now after plugging in all the results, it doesn't really work as when two movies have the same values - the machine doesn't produce a result - or produces the incorrect one.

I'm styling this, and leaving it for now. perhaps to return later.

**Thoughts** I know without a shadow of a doubt there is an easier way to do this. I just don't know what it is and that is ever so slightly agonising. Still I get to trawl through Messina's filmography which was a treat.
