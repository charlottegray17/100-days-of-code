# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday May 4, 2020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Declared I would be beginning challenge. Read articles on Free Code Camp, wrote down my why and decided to progress through Free Code Camp's course as well as working on Skillcrush/Personal Projects during this 100 day period.

**Thoughts:** I am AFRAID. Learning to code and getting a job in development, is something that has been on my mind for a WHILE. Whether or not I would able to hack it is something that's also constantly looming in my head. My inability to progress through previous courses has also made me feel like this is something that's beyond me. If I can commit for these 100 days, I think that will do wonders for my own self-belief that this is something I CAN do.

### Day 1: Tuesday May 5th, 2020 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Began Free Code Camp's Course. Moved through 100% of HTML, now 15% through CSS

**Thoughts**: I really liked a lot of the things said in this blog post yesterday. I flew through html because I am familiar with a lot of it, but there was still some new things that I picked up. Going through these in a different arena will help me iron out the issues I have with feeling like there are aspects of the basics/fundamentals that I am missing.

### Day 2: Wednesday May 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS and moved into Applied Visual Design, 35% through.

**Thoughts** It's quite cool, going through these classes. As initially when I read the name of a lot of the tasks, I thought I didn't know how to do them, but on the whole I actually do. This is reinforcing how much I actually do know, and have learnt in the past weeks and goodness even years. At first, these now 'easy' things were complicated, so I will endeavour to not get too overwhelmed when getting into the meatier stuff. As one day those complex ideas will be something I take in my stride too - she says!

I came across an adorable css penguin in one of today's challenges and I want to try making something like this. Excited for my first project.
