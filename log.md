# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday May 4, 2020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Declared I would be beginning challenge. Read articles on Free Code Camp, wrote down my why and decided to progress through Free Code Camp's course as well as working on Skillcrush/Personal Projects during this 100 day period.

**Thoughts:** I am AFRAID. Learning to code and getting a job in development, is something that has been on my mind for a WHILE. Whether or not I would able to hack it is something that's also constantly looming in my head. My inability to progress through previous courses has also made me feel like this is something that's beyond me. If I can commit for these 100 days, I think that will do wonders for my own self-belief that this is something I CAN do.

### Day 1: Tuesday May 5th, 2020 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Began Free Code Camp's Course. Moved through 100% of HTML, now 15% through CSS

**Thoughts**: I really liked a lot of the things said in this blog post yesterday. I flew through html because I am familiar with a lot of it, but there was still some new things that I picked up. Going through these in a different arena will help me iron out the issues I have with feeling like there are aspects of the basics/fundamentals that I am missing.

### Day 2: Wednesday May 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS and moved into Applied Visual Design, 35% through.

**Thoughts** It's quite cool, going through these classes. As initially when I read the name of a lot of the tasks, I thought I didn't know how to do them, but on the whole I actually do. This is reinforcing how much I actually do know, and have learnt in the past weeks and goodness even years. At first, these now 'easy' things were complicated, so I will endeavour to not get too overwhelmed when getting into the meatier stuff. As one day those complex ideas will be something I take in my stride too - she says!

I came across an adorable css penguin in one of today's challenges and I want to try making something like this. Excited for my first project.

### Day 3: Thursday May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 75% way through Applied Visual Design now. Tried making a little landing page to show how my heart swells re-watching Glee lol. Will animate tomorrow.

**Thoughts** hsl colour codes - never heard of them. Thought at first, why on earth would you want this? Then did an exercise with them and realised they're pretty dang cool.
Encountered how the transform property works!
animated my first key frames, omg

### Day 4: Friday May 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Visual Design and now onto accessibility design. 30% through.

Tried animating my heart, but for the life of me, wasn't able to make the heart change color completely on hover. I know it's because of the class name '.heart:after/before' messing it up, but I don't know how to resolve it.

In other news, learn the basics of css animations. Thought about trying to make a digital landscape with sparkling stars.

**Thoughts** Watched some videos on software engineering. Considering if this path is too difficult. If tech was for me, wouldn't I have cracked it by now? In other news, pleased with the accountability that this challenge is putting on me.

### Day 5: Sunday May 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed accessibility design. Picked up a lot of new info about forms and tabindex's that I didn't previously know. In fact, about 90% of this curriculum was new to me.

**Thoughts** Think I got discouraged over the weekend, but back on track today. Got in 30 mins, tomorrow will push for whole hour. Will be starting on responsive, which is where I've stumbled with Skillcrush course so I think it will be fruitful.

### Day 6: Monday May 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had the random idea for a Chris Messina movie generator after watching 'Blame' last night. Who doesn't want a tool to tell them just which Chris project to fire up depending on their mood?

Planned out the build, it built the html shell. Took a good mo to remember the js essentials but got there.

Now to figure out how to display the info I want. I'm not sure if I need to build a PHP form, or create if/else statements for each different answer combination. I think the latter is certainly not the right answer.

**Thoughts** This was fun. Definitely more enjoyable than going through tutorials. When there's no solution to download to check, I feel a bit more like I'm really making something new which is cool.

### Day 7: Tuesday May 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through responsive web design

**Thoughts** Very tired so didn't get uber far. keep thinking about how I'm going to produce these results for movie generator. I think the answer could be in javascript, but at this stage have kind of no ID where to start. Thinking will likely move on and come back at later date.

### Day 8: Wednesday May 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on trying to crack Javascript functions for project.

**Thoughts** Who knew this movie generator would be such a touch cookie to crack!? Came up with the answer to produce results seemingly in my dreams. I think I need to assign each movie a number, prep the appearance (description, title and img) and then find a way to make the options the user chooses, equal a number which we correspond with the relevant movie and throw up the info.

If only it was so easily done! Am having a good time trying to wrap›¢›› my head around this. When I figure it, I think I may feel invincible.

### Day 9: Thursday May 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit on portfolio landing page.
Making it responsive, and positioning images for once and for all with new knowledge.

**Thoughts** I have been working on this for far too long XD

### Day 10: Friday May 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started in on Flexbox

**Thoughts** My eyes are red. Will pick up tomorrow with fresh eyes!

**To Do's**

### Day 11: Sunday May 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through Flexbox. Built a calculator. Tried to apply calculator reasoning to movie generator. Still not hitting the spot mate. Missed a day yesterday. Will style my calculator later.

**Thoughts** This movie generator may be the death of me

UPDATE: It's now technically Monday, but there has been a BREAKTHROUGH!

Movie generator is partially up and running!!!

**Tonight's Progress**: After many failed attempts, but some really good thinking if I say so myself I have used js statements to get the generator to produce results as hoped. It's quite prescriptive due to all 5 statements need to be a certain result, before producing the one Messina title that matches all the statements, but I did it. And I did it on my own which feels good.

I also figured out a few things along the way about how best to call variables, different ways to display them on the page, and how to work with commenting out code. I used trial and error on certain function over and over to determine why the weren't working at what needed to be done to make them function. w3Schools and Stackoverflow I know very well are going to be my new home.

Tomorrow, I will finish plugging in the answers. I'm not sure what will happen in the case that two titles yield from the same results. That will be a good experiment to run I suppose!

Still it's now 02:14 am and I am done for the night. I will rest soundly for the next 5 hours.

### Day 12: Monday May 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made breakthrough with generator in the early hours, but now after plugging in all the results, it doesn't really work as when two movies have the same values - the machine doesn't produce a result - or produces the incorrect one.

I'm styling this, and leaving it for now. perhaps to return later.

**Thoughts** I know without a shadow of a doubt there is an easier way to do this. I just don't know what it is and that is ever so slightly agonising. Still I get to trawl through Messina's filmography which was a treat.

## Day 13: Tuesday May 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Teensy tiny bit of css styling before bed

**Thoughts**

## Day 14: Wednesday May 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Picked back up Skillcrush project - Unplugged Responsive Website. Coded Desktop styles, and now moving into CSS Styling.

**Thoughts** On the horse much earlier in the day today. Not quite found the routine of at which time I'm most productive - but as long as I get something done I'm pleased.

I recall getting very upset with myself on this project before because of the base styling being nothing like the example code, but honestly I hadn't done that bad a job looking back at it now. If I know anything, it's that there will always be a bunch of diff ways to do things so as long as it works that's all good.   

## Day 15: Saturday May 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Unplugged Responsive Website. Ironing out structural issues with the site and styling.

**Thoughts** Missed two days, but picking back up where I left off. Whilst I'm not adhering to the rules of the challenge, I'm still showing up as often as I can which for me is still progress and positive.

I think flexbox is making a bit more sense now. I had some margin, padding structural issues in my code, which I was able to iron out.

Learning about the global styles was very helpful with the responsive way of styling, and it is something I have yet to encounter. Whilst I do like styling the sites, I look forward to trying some more backend stuff, that's a bit different from my day to day work.

Programming the Generator, whilst not 100% successful, was still fun to try and work out and get right. I think I can see myself doing more stuff down that route as opposed to web design 24/7 but we shall see.




[SECOND TRY]


# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday June 30, 2020

If at first you don't succeed, try try again.

**Today's Progress**:
Picked back up responsive web design project unplugged. Added in responsive images, and fixed some flexbox issues across devices.

Will start on design for Jenny and I's project log.

**Thoughts:** Started again on the 100days of code challenge and I will complete this time. I am committed to making this career change. I do not want to be in this same position in 2021. The uncertainty I felt the first time round still remains, but I do believe I can do anything I put my mind to. And I WILL do this.

My goal is to do something code related each day. I wan't to complete my Skillcrush course and be applying for jobs by September.

### Day 2: Wednesday July 1, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Completely finished mobile build of unplugged project. OMG! Got the map in the frame (solo, I might add) also was introduced to icon fonts (incredible btw). Will save so much time.

Will start on design for Jenny and I's project log.

**Thoughts:** Days like today when things just go right, make all of the struggle days seem worth it. Maybe I'm not as shockingly bad as I thought. Flexbox still leans in and out of making sense but with more practice, in particular building this new site with Jenny, I feel like things will start to fall into place. (She says)

That's not to say everything worked first time today, it truly didn't. But I was able to deduce the problems, which was really great. I actually was able to see what was wrong, use the developer tool to pinpoint the problem and then address it. Less guess work here and more actual solving - GRAND!

Tomorrow - I will aim to get desktop and tablet versions completed. Then I can 'unplug' from this project!

### Day 3: Thursday July 2, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Finished almost all of tablet device styling. Just features bit on homepage giving me some grief! Designed portfolio site for I and Jenny's projects.

**Thoughts:** Was going well, needed to do some trial and error to figure things out across devices. I feel like my code is VERY messy. Well actually it's not a feeling it's a certainty. I endeavour to just get THROUGH this project, and aim for a cleaner code in the next one.

Flexbox is a tricky bugger. It originally seemed like the answer to all my prayers. Need to get back to that space. may go through the flexbox classes once again, or check out some other resources on it, so I can really get a grip on it, and narrow down on the guess work!

### Day 4: Friday July 3, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Finished styling across ALL DEVICES. I am so happy! Flexbox is still a very cruel mistress, we tousled tonight, but I came out victorious. My CSS is messy, this I am 100% certain of - I'm not going to try and clean it now, but rather move on and work towards being more succinct and concise when styling in future.

**Thoughts:** Pleased to be able to pass this milestone. This project is what initially knocked me off the wagon, as I had felt that everything was so wrong. Now looking at it finished, this feels like a big deal. Excited to go get frustrated by a different project now please, thank you.

### Day 5: Saturday July 4, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Established connection to mine and Jenny's shared repo. Built desktop design comps, and pushed to github.

**Thoughts:** Good to be back in github for something other than pushing the log (no offence). Not sure if im pulling and pushing right but we'll see how it's worked out for Jenny on the other side. Tomorrow heading back into Javascript.

Also need to get back on to my own portfolio. Maybe I will look into building the pages and then coming back to landing page as it's giving me so much trouble! Want to complete it as it's had so much thought go into it.

### Day 6: Sunday July 5, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Went through code camps classes on Flexbox. Finished off skillcrush module on testing sites.

**Thoughts:** Unplugged isn't quite as perfect as thought but that was to be expected. Will revisit later on.

Now one module away from being ready to apply for jobs according to Skilllcrush fast track. I have 100% done the javascript course already, will progress through again to see if it makes any further sense to me. Kind of can't believe that I have the skills needed to apply for jobs. Though the number one thing I need but don't have? BLOODY PORTFOLIO.

### Day 7: Monday July 6, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Followed Fireship tutorial on building responsive navigation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biOMz4puGt8

**Thoughts:** Will take this knowledge to work on the hamburger for my site, as well as mobile nav - and static sidenav for team project. Will start on those tomorrow, and hopefully get through a bit of CSS grid.

### Day 8: Tuesday July 7, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Stayed up into early hours working on team navbar and landing page which went surprisingly well.

**Thoughts:** I don't want to get carried away and say things are falling into place, but I did really enjoy the experience. And recalled a lot from the initial tutorial which was positive. Got a new accountability partner in Alex for my portfolio, so it really really truly is getting done this month. IT HAS TO. I will not enter into August without it.

### Day 9: Wednesday July 8, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Followed Traversy Media tutorial to make my own hamburger menu oh my gaashhh! I love it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZg6UfS5zYg. Worked on some more designs for portfolio to hand over to Alex.

**Thoughts:** Will repurpose this for my own portfolio hamburger menu. This is just like what I had wanted. I would like the animation to not be circle but instead fold out from the top left/top right corner (wherever the button is).

I would also then like the menu buttons to align to the right and display illustrations large on the left - showcasing the animations!!

Following tutorials is proving really useful for me in learning more ways to use CSS. I had no idea about all of these pseudo classes and sub selectors. I had no idea you could create so much using JUST html and CSS. I think I've been under the impression Skillcrush was providing all I needed to know, when really it was just an introduction.

Observing tutorials, and then putting my own spin on them is the bridge I need before jumping into whole projects - I think that will also provide the foundation I will need to actually get through my own projects. I thought the recently laid to rest Chris Messina Project https://github.com/charlottegray17/chris-generator-improved would be a very simple project, but in hindsight what I was trying to do was probably a bit complex for my current knowledge.

I hope to look back at the end of this challenge, or perhaps, and be able to pick out what was wrong with my approach, and try again.

### Day 10: Thursday July 9, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Tried fetching Jenny's code but had no luck. Not sure what I'm doing wrong, feel like mac needs a good ole reboot. Will give it that today. Finished up landing page and extra assets that are getting done for Alex.  

**Thoughts:** Today ended up being more design than code, but hey all working towards the same end goal. Did my last tweaks for now to landing page to make something I'm actually happy with. Happy to push forward with this now.

### Day 11: Friday July 10, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Started CSS Grid, and started customizing hamburger nav  

**Thoughts:** Was able to merge some fo the knowledge of the previous nav with this one which is cool. Very happy about these puesdo selectors, and variable - very helpful for styling. Will be good to gain more of this knowledge.

### Day 12: Saturday July 11, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Went through CSS grid on freecodecamp. ---As the evening went on, ended up getting most of structure for portfolio DOWN. Landing, about and blog page set up.

**Thoughts:** Knowing this will be super useful for portfolio page in jenny and I's project. Still haven't been able to download that hmmm ---Feel like this may be a slight nightmare to make responsive but we are making progress in this, in that, I can physical see it, and click around it which feels like a big deal, if juvenile.

These are plans that I mapped out over a year ago, it's nice to see it coming to fruition. Trying to do it justice without perfectionism killing me. Aim is to be done by end of month, and it feels pretty on track.

## Day 13: Sunday July 12, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
Created image slider using CSS with  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw3fOHnzCjI. Results were a little wonky. Transition moved all round the image, and also there was some flickering between image for know real reason that I could tell. Decided it would likely be best to use Javascript for long term and so search for a diff tutorial.

Used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YQ4svkETS0. Manipulated images in photoshop and popped behind my calendar template. In hindsight, probably could have skewed these images with CSS.

Watched CSS positioning in 9 mins https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5jmI0UlXU
Watched Kevin Powell's before and after pseudo classes series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoRbkm8XgfQ

**Thoughts:** Not sure how easy it will be to slot the above into landing page. I am certain it won't be half as simple as I hope it will lol

Javascript is such a conundrum for me. At first I thought I wasn't going to go through Skillcrush module again but I think I need to to see if it's gotten any easier. I've been quite comfy in the past writing some functions and methods, but just getting to this image slider today ... I have no idea how I would've been able to write that from scratch.

Javascript is also up next on free code camp so that is somewhat comforting. I need A LOT of work in this area.

## Day 14: Monday July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got annoyed trying to sort hamburger menu to reveal from the top left. Transform-origin is what I need, but it's still glitching. Not sure what to do here, so have kind of settled for a pop up menu instead.

**Thoughts:** Feel very defeated when I can't get simple things to work. Added calendar onto landing page, and again when it came to setting it into page it was fine, but as soon as I try to resize page it throw's everything off which is muy muy annoying.

Worked on a tribute site for free code camp. 1 of 5 challenges before moving onto javascript. Not super impressive stylistically, but passes the tests: https://charlottegray17.github.io/tmp-tribute-site/. Flexbox still wasn't doing exactly what I hoped, but I'm just hoping if I blindly pursue this course, everything will fall into place.

## Day 15: Tuesday July 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Nada. Watched a couple coding related YT vids. Started updating linked in.

**Thoughts:** Was feeling very melancholy and defeated. Tired and annoyed from work so didn't physically do anything productive. Instead of adding a day to the end just going to say tomorrow is also Day 15. Also will bring me into sync with the actual date for the rest of the month.

## Day 15: Wednesday July 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed form test from https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form

Kept getting stuck on user story 10#, but after some swift research, some text was needed in between label and input tags to describe what user needed to do with field. I had already added this in separately, so was missing the point, but ultimately that makes SENSE! Voila, I have a goofy Stars Hollow Quiz.

**Thoughts:** I didn't spend too much time on the styling again, but was able to get a few things I wanted sorted with flexbox and some alternative methods of displaying images. Want to progress through these projects so that I can move onto Javascript. Though I appreciate if I do these projects well they could feature in portfolio. Not really sure if they're strong enough to though? Maybe I can come back to make more of an effort once I've learnt more.

I feel like bashing my head against CSS is not a particular good use of my time atm, especially when there's still so much turmoil about this path. I want to move more into the back end stuff to see if that's more for me.

I am going to put all my effort into not doubting this path until the 100 days are done. Let me blindly pursue it for that long with second guessing before falling off the wagon. If I at least give it that long, and nothing comes of it - then I can feel confident in the fact that I gave it a good go. Like, a really good go. Can't say i've ever done anything EVERY day for a 100 days before. Except maybe drawing, but that was long ago now. Moving on, Day 16 here we come.

## Day 16: Thursday July 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started 3rd Responsive Web Design challenge: product landing page. Passed 13/16 tests on first try which is coooool.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a lot more inspired styling wise tonight, so I'm not a complete useless pea. Will try to get this finished tomorrow so can move into bigger stuff.

Started watching PHP videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVU3V0A05k8, thinking it could be interesting to introduce myself to this language which I need, as it may also make solidifying JS knowledge better.

It will also be good to finally be able to link my forms up to something as well!

## Day 17: Friday July 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Just a little styling today on product landing page.

**Thoughts:** Getting a bit carried away but nearly done. Will make sure passes all tests tomorrow.

## Day 18: Saturday July 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got landing page finished! Passing all tests, and fully responsive on two platforms.

**Thoughts:** Figured out the best way to place video is to put it within a container. Kind of figuring that is the case with all elements. Put inside container for more control on position and styling. Onwards we go!

## Day 19: Sunday July 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**:Very late one tonight, whole RWD technical page challenge complete! Just realised didn't actually check the tests were passed goodness gracious. I'm pleased with what i've made though! Took some troubleshooting to arrive.

**Thoughts:** Eye's are burnin. Will reflect more in the morn.
