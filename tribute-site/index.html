          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The Mindy Project, created by the illustrious and glamorous Mindy Kaling is a love letter to the Romantic Comedy genre and the modern day woman.<br>
          <br>Over 5 seasons, although I try to erase the latter 2 from memory, Kaling introduces us to Lahiri. A fiercley hilarious succesful woman adamant on finding love in the big city.<br>
          <br>Through a comedy of errors, we follow Mindy through a series of romantic, and disastrous misadventures around New York City as she looks for love. Until one day, it turns out; it was closer than she thought all along.</p>
